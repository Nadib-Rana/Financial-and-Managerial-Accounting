**The Users of Accounting Data**

Accounting can be divided into two main fields: **financial accounting** and **managerial accounting**.

1. **Financial Accounting**: This field provides information for **external decision-makers**, such as **investors** and **lenders**. Financial accounting offers data to outsiders who are interested in the financial status of the company.

2. **Managerial Accounting**: This field focuses on providing information for **internal decision-makers**, like **company managers**. Managerial accounting provides data to insiders to assist in planning and making business decisions.

### Two Broad Groups of Users of Financial Information

1. **Internal Users**  
   Internal users include those within the organization who need accounting information for running the business. Examples of internal users are:

   - **Business Owners**: Business owners use accounting information to set goals, track progress, and make necessary adjustments. For example, Sheena Bright, the owner of Smart Touch, can use financial statements to determine if her business is profitable enough to justify buying another computer.
   
   - **Managers**: Managers rely on accounting data to plan, organize, and run various functions within the business. These managers may include **marketing managers**, **production supervisors**, **finance directors**, and **company officers**. They use accounting information to assess the financial and operational health of the business, which helps in making informed decisions.

2. **External Users**  
   External users consist of those outside the organization who need financial information to evaluate the businessâ€™s performance. These users typically include investors, creditors, and government agencies. Financial statements provide these users with data to make investment, lending, and regulatory decisions.
