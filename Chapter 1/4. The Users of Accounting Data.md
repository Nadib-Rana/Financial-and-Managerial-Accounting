**The Users of Accounting Data**

Accounting provides essential information for two main groups through its two fields: **financial accounting** and **managerial accounting**.

1. **Financial Accounting**: This field provides information for **external decision-makers**, such as **investors** and **lenders**. Financial accounting offers data to outsiders who are interested in the financial condition of the company.

2. **Managerial Accounting**: This field focuses on information for **internal decision-makers**, such as **company managers**. Managerial accounting provides data to insiders to help them in planning and decision-making within the organization.

### Two Broad Groups of Users of Financial Information

1. **Internal Users**  
   These users include individuals within the organization who need accounting data to operate the business effectively. Some examples are:

   - **Business Owners**: Owners use accounting information to set goals, measure progress, and make adjustments when necessary. For example, Sheena Bright, the owner of Smart Touch, may refer to financial statements to decide if her business is profitable enough to purchase a new computer.

   - **Managers**: Managers rely on accounting data to plan, organize, and run the business. This includes roles such as **marketing managers**, **production supervisors**, and **finance directors**, who use accounting information to monitor financial and operational health and make informed decisions.

2. **External Users**  
   External users include individuals or organizations outside the business who rely on financial information to evaluate its performance. These users typically include **investors**, **creditors**, and **government agencies**. Financial statements provide them with necessary data for making decisions about investments, loans, and regulatory requirements.
