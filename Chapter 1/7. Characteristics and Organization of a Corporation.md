**Characteristics and Organization of a Corporation**

A corporation is a legal entity that is separate from its owners, known as shareholders. It is one of the most complex forms of business organization, with distinct characteristics and a structured organization. Below are the key characteristics and organizational structure of a corporation:

### Characteristics of a Corporation

1. **Legal Entity**:
   - A corporation is recognized as a separate legal entity from its owners, which means it can enter contracts, own assets, sue, and be sued in its own name.

2. **Limited Liability**:
   - Shareholders have limited liability, meaning their personal assets are protected from the corporation's debts and liabilities. They can only lose the amount they invested in the corporation.

3. **Perpetual Existence**:
   - A corporation has an unlimited lifespan and continues to exist even if ownership changes or shareholders die. This is known as perpetual existence.

4. **Transferability of Shares**:
   - Ownership in a corporation is represented by shares of stock, which can be easily bought and sold. This makes it easier for shareholders to transfer their ownership interests.

5. **Double Taxation**:
   - Corporations are subject to double taxation, where the corporation pays taxes on its profits, and shareholders pay taxes again on dividends received.

6. **Regulatory Compliance**:
   - Corporations must adhere to various regulations and reporting requirements, including filing annual reports and financial statements.

### Organization of a Corporation

The organizational structure of a corporation typically includes several key components:

1. **Shareholders**:
   - Shareholders are the owners of the corporation. They elect the board of directors and have voting rights on major corporate decisions.

2. **Board of Directors**:
   - The board is elected by the shareholders to oversee the corporation's management and make major decisions. They are responsible for setting corporate policy, approving budgets, and hiring executive officers.

3. **Executive Officers**:
   - Executive officers, such as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and Chief Operating Officer (COO), manage the day-to-day operations of the corporation. They report to the board of directors.

4. **Committees**:
   - Corporations often establish committees within the board of directors to focus on specific areas, such as audit, compensation, and governance. These committees provide oversight and recommendations to the full board.

5. **Employees**:
   - Employees work under the direction of the executive officers to carry out the corporationâ€™s operations and achieve its objectives. They are essential for the corporation's daily functioning.
