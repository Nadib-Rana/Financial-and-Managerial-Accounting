### Basic Concepts and Principles of Accounting

The main goal of financial reporting is to give useful information for making investment and lending decisions. For information to be useful, it needs to be relevant, reliable, and easy to compare. Here are some key accounting concepts and principles:

**1. Economic Entity Concept**  
This concept states that a business is a separate entity from its owners. Each business's activities are kept separate to accurately track its performance. For example, if ABC Company spends $30,000 to buy stock, this amount is treated separately from the personal assets of its owner, Mr. Haque. This separation helps measure the business's success clearly.

**2. Monetary Unit Concept**  
According to this concept, only transactions that can be measured in monetary terms are included in accounting records. For example, while the mood of employees or the quality of service is important, these aspects can't be easily quantified in dollars, so they are not recorded in the financial statements.

**3. Going-Concern Concept**  
This principle assumes that a business will continue operating for the foreseeable future. It means accountants expect the company to use its resources to generate profits over time. For example, if a store is closing down, its assets might be valued based on current market prices. However, since most businesses stay open, they typically use historical costs (what they paid for their assets) in their records.

**4. Cost Principle**  
The cost principle says that assets should be recorded at their actual purchase price (historical cost). This means that if a company buys land for $20,000, it records the land at this cost, even if the market value later increases to $30,000. The price remains at $20,000 in the accounting records for reliability.

**5. Faithful Representation Principle**  
This principle ensures that financial information accurately reflects what it represents. It means the data should be complete, neutral, and free from significant errors. For example, if Smart Touch buys land for $20,000, that amount is the true representation of its value, not the owner's belief that it might be worth $25,000. The actual purchase price is more reliable for accounting purposes.
