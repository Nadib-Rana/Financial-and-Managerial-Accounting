### Accounting Equation

The **basic accounting equation** is:

### **Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity**

#### Key Components

1. **Assets**: 
   - What the business owns (e.g., cash, inventory, equipment).

2. **Liabilities**: 
   - What the business owes (e.g., loans, bills).

3. **Owner's Equity**: 
   - The owner's share in the business (e.g., invested money and profits kept in the business).

### Importance

- The equation always balances: what a business owns must equal what it owes plus the owner's claim.
- Changes in one part of the equation affect the others (e.g., getting a loan increases both assets and liabilities). 

This equation is essential for understanding a business's financial health.
