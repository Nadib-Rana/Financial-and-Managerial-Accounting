### Accounting Equation

The **basic accounting equation** is:

### **Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity**

#### Key Components

1. **Assets**: 
   - **Definition**: Resources owned by the business that provide future economic benefits. 
   - **Example**: Cash, inventory, buildings, equipment, and accounts receivable.

2. **Liabilities**: 
   - **Definition**: Obligations or debts that the business owes to external parties. 
   - **Example**: Loans, accounts payable, mortgages, and other financial obligations.

3. **Owner's Equity**: 
   - **Definition**: The residual interest in the assets of the business after deducting liabilities. It represents the owner's investment in the business. 
   - **Example**: Capital contributions and retained earnings (profits reinvested in the business).
