### The Ledger

The **ledger** is a collection of accounts that records all transactions related to a specific account. It provides a more detailed view of each account's activity, including debits and credits over time. Each account in the ledger contains all the transactions that affect that account, making it easier to track balances and financial activities.

#### Types of Ledgers:
1. **General Ledger**: Contains all accounts for recording transactions.
2. **Subsidiary Ledger**: Contains details of specific accounts that are summarized in the general ledger (e.g., accounts receivable, accounts payable).

#### Key Components of a Ledger Entry:
- **Date**: The date of the transaction.
- **Description**: A brief explanation of the transaction.
- **Debit and Credit Columns**: Amounts debited and credited to the account.
- **Balance**: The running total of the account after each transaction.
