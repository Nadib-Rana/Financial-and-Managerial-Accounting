An *account* in accounting is an individual record that tracks increases and decreases in a specific asset, liability, or owner's equity item. Each account provides a structured way to record these changes, and it typically consists of three parts:

1. **Title** – The name of the account, which identifies the type of financial item it represents (e.g., Cash, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable).
2. **Debit Side (Left Side)** – This side records increases for assets and expenses, and decreases for liabilities and equity accounts.
3. **Credit Side (Right Side)** – This side records increases for liabilities, equity, and revenue accounts, and decreases for assets and expenses.
