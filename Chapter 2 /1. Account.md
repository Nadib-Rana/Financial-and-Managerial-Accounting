An *account* in accounting is an individual record that tracks increases and decreases in a specific asset, liability, or owner's equity item. Each account provides a structured way to record these changes, and it typically consists of three parts:

1. **Title** – The name of the account, which identifies the type of financial item it represents (e.g., Cash, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable).
2. **Debit Side (Left Side)** – This side records increases for assets and expenses, and decreases for liabilities and equity accounts.
3. **Credit Side (Right Side)** – This side records increases for liabilities, equity, and revenue accounts, and decreases for assets and expenses.

*Debits* and *credits* are the two sides of every accounting transaction, used to record changes in accounts. Here’s a simple breakdown:

1. **Debits** (left side):
   - Increase assets (what the business owns).
   - Increase expenses (costs of running the business).
   - Decrease liabilities (what the business owes).
   - Decrease equity (owner’s claim on assets).

2. **Credits** (right side):
   - Increase liabilities (what the business owes).
   - Increase equity (owner’s claim on assets).
   - Increase revenue (income earned).
   - Decrease assets (what the business owns).

In accounting, the total amount of debits must always equal the total amount of credits for each transaction, keeping the records balanced.
